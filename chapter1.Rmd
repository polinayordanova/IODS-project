Hello! I am looking forward to learning more about Open Data Science. I learned about the course by fellow students and I think it will be very useful for my PhD project.  I have some basic programming experience (XSLT), but R seems a *little* intimidating! I hope to get the hang of it soon!

My GitHub repository is https://github.com/polinayordanova/IODS-project.
